					<p class="article"> The origin of fanservice in anime is unknown; however, this concept is nothing new in the animation scene... </p>
					<p class="article"> And yeah, nobody cares about a fully documented thing about how fanservice began and how fanservice affect how anime's popularity and spread. I know you guys came here for some fanservicing pictures present in anime. Well let me tell you that fanservice is really Dio. </p>
					<p class="article"> Dio has been the fanservice all long since Jojo's Bizarre Adventure came out. I know many  anime fans where like "ohhhh Dio damn" as to be turn on or "No it's Dio, no my virgin eyes" as to protect your virginity. That's why animator keep Dio on for so long in the Jojo series. The animators knew that Dio was the fanservice, and anime fans will keep on watching Jojo because of that.</p>
					<p class="article"> That's why anime has been the fanservice media as that the beginning of fanservice started with Dio, and it will end with Dio. However, Dio will not be stop being shown, so fanservice will not stop in anime. </p>
